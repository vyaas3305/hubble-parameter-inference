# Parameter inferences using Hubble's constant
This repository contains Jupyter notebooks for constraining and finding the best-fit values of various parameters in the Hubble parameter model using Bayesian methods.

## Problem Statement
Given a dataset for Hubble's parameter at various redshifts, constrain and find the best fit values for m, k, and V.
Plot 1D and 2D marginalized probability distributions for all three parameters and report uncertainties
Note that the dataset contains associated errors for Hubble Parameter. Include those errors in your analysis
